Error: error validating driver installation: error creating symlink creator: failed to create NVIDIA device nodes: failed to create device node nvidiactl: failed to determine major: invalid device node
Failed to create symlinks under /dev/char that point to all possible NVIDIA character devices.
The existence of these symlinks is required to address the following bug: https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator/issues/430
This bug impacts container runtimes configured with systemd cgroup management enabled.
To disable the symlink creation, set the following envvar in 
ClusterPolicy:
    validator:
          driver:
                 env:
                         - name: DISABLE_DEV_CHAR_SYMLINK_CREATION
                           value: \"true\""
